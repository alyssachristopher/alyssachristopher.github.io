<h1>Personal Statement : Alyssa Christopher</h1>


<p><strong>My Background</strong></p>
	<p>My name is Alyssa and I am a sophomore in the Woods College. I am majoring in psychology and I would like to be a behavioral analyst for the FBI. I am from Medford Massachusetts and I do not have any previous IT or web development experience.</p>

<p><strong>My Interest in Web Development</strong></p>
	<p>I do not have any plans for future web development work.</p>

<p><strong>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports or Hobbies</strong></p>
	<p>I was a competitive dancer for 16 years. I competed in ballet, tap, jazz, hip hop, production, lyric, modern, contemporary, solos, duos, and trios. I also take part in the Special Olympics Massachusetts. I have been going with my father, who is a Boston College police officer, since I was 8 years old and it has been a passion of mine ever since. This is because my brother was born with Down Syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>What I Hope to Gain from this Course</strong></p>
	<p>I hope to gain an overall better understanding of coding and how everything we use everyday is created and how it all works together to make what we see.</p>

<p><strong>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About</strong></p>
	<p>There is nothing in specific I would like to learn about. I am interested in art and I would like to see how that transfers over into website design.</p>
