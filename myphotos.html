<p>This is a sunflower field that my boyfriend, his family, and I went to at Coppal House Farm in Lee, New Hampshire. This was a part of the Sunflower Festival that takes place there every year. They grow multiple sunflower fields for different activities like pictures, a maze, and weddings. This photo was taken from the bridge in the maze they had created and it shows all the sunflowers that were surrounding the bridge.</p>

<p>This is a photo of one of the lions at the Franklin Park Zoo. They have a safari truck that has been half placed in the enclosure so you can feel up close and personal with the lions. I sat in the truck and one of the lions came up and posed right infront of the truck for me.</p>

<p>This is a photo of a sunset on Newfound Lake in Bristol, New Hampshire. My boyfriend has a cottage right on the lake and his family and I were hanging out on the dock watching the sunset. This is one of the popular lakes in New Hampshire especially for the holidays.</p>
